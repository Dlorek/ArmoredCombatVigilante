# About the addon

[Armored Combat Vigilante] is a higly edited version of [ACF-3 ](https://github.com/ACF-Team/ACF-3) 

*"Okay but what's it about?"*

Well, it's about making working contraptions that involve warfare, or just to make silly vehicles. The addon adds a variety of stuff.

*"Like what?"* You may ask, well, we give you many to choose from engines, cannons, to missles........or to Nukes.....

Because let's be clear, who doesnt like big stuff that blows up? 

*"What made you do it?"* Well, i started the project for a server started at the name ACK, but it was kinda scrapped. I came back to the project after a ACF-3 update, and my EGO was too big for me to adapt to the new mechanics, and so i changed the name to a little bit less cringy and resumed the project once again.
